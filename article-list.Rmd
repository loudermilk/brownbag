**Upcoming Events:**
10/23/15 (12 pm - 1 pm) - small lunch room, TCS 9th floor; discussion leader: loudermilk; article = "Characterizing the Google Book Corpus"


**Notes** - we can decide on changes to the format this friday, but for now I suggest we just round-robin starting at the top of the queue with the discussion leader being the person who proposed the article.


This is a list of suggested articles to read:

 [ ] [Characterizing the Google Books Corpus: Strong Limits to Inferences of Socio-Cultural and Linguistic Evolution](http://www.plosone.org/article/Authors/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0137041)

 [ ] [Change Point Detection in Time Series with R and Tableau](http://www.r-bloggers.com/change-point-detection-in-time-series-with-r-and-tableau/)
