Randomization is somewhat analogous to insurance, in that it
is a precaution against disturbances that may or may not occur
and that may or may not be serious if they do occur. It is gen-
erally advisable to take the trouble to randomize even when it is
not expected that there will be any serious bias from failure to
randomize. The experimenter is thus protected against unusual
events that upset his expectations. - Cochran and Cox (1957)
