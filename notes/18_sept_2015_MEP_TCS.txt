I. Integrating CS into team
 
                a) didn't have time to discuss this much
 
 
II. Where does this team fit within TCS?
 
                a) good start
               
                b) everyone is here to improve skills
               
                c) let's grind and shine, homies
               
               
III. Areas where we're lacking (see below)
               
 
III. Going forward -- let's get focused
 
                a) Regular Knowledge Share / Journal Club
                               
                                - Blog
                                                -- CS will take care of this (let's do a Wiki)
 
                b) Shared office space?
               
                                - Not sure who to talk to about this
               
                c) Courses
                               
                                - Good for regular knowledge share, particularly if people are taking different courses
                               
                d) Kaggle competition
               
                                - let's form a small team and try a first competition
                               
                                - maybe even do an informal Hackathon one Saturday (not in the office)
                                               
                                - Brandon will look into getting private GH repo
 
                e) DS meetups and conferences
               
                                - something to look into further
                               
                f) Increase biz knowledge
               
                                - find min(DB) work, read it, meet to discuss once per month
